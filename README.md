Pollinators provide sociocultural, biological and economic values for humankind by safeguarding biodiversity and crop yields through the pollination of wild plants and flowering crops. However, pollinators face multiple threats that are affecting their health, populations and diversity. A particular threat to pollinator health comes from a potential escalation of disease risk by environmental changes that alter pollinator nutrition, abundance, species interactions and communities. VOODOO aims to address this knowledge gap by discovering how land-use (conventional intensive agriculture, rural mosaic or urban land) and alien plant species drive modifications to the availability and quality of floral resources that in turn affect the structure and dynamics of plant-pollinator-virus communitie.
